            <h3>Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection</h3>
            <p class="proJust">Credit card fraud avoidance has been the most popular problem in the developed world. 
                When a credit card is stolen it is used for dishonest reasons, a fraudster uses the credit card information for his own purposes, and it is called credit card theft. 
                In order to track online fraud transactions, the new technology employs a variety of methods. To increase the consistency of the proposed scheme, we used a Machine learning algorithm to find suspicious transactions.
                It is built on supervised learning algorithm. After the dataset has been categorized, analysis and visualize then a confusion matrix is established. 
                Two most important algorithms such as Logistic regression and random forest has been applied for the purpose.
                Detect Fraudulent Credit Card transactions using different Machine Learning models and compare performances        
                In this notebook, I explore various Machine Learning models to detect fraudulent use of Credit cards.
                I compare each model performance and results. The best performance is achieved using SMOTE technique.                
                Please note that this approach can be transferred to other detection analysis in alternatrive domains. 
                The feature extraction process remains similar and can be replicated on many other detection issues.</p>

            <h3>Daylight Saving Time</h3>
            <p>The principle of Daylight Saving Time(DST) to optimize energy efficiency,particularly in the context of lighting consumption. 
                Recognize the year-round benefits of DST in conserving energy,with a nuanced understanding of its impact,including its slight reduction in effectiveness during winter due to later sunrises.
                Skilled at managing time adjustments associated with DST transitions to maximize daylight utilization.</p>
